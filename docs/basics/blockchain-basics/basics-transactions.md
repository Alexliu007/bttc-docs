# What is a transaction?
A "transaction" refers to a signed packet that contains a message sent from one account to another account on the blockchain. Messages can be divided into two main categories:

* Value Transfer
A certain amount of ETH is transferred between two external accounts, both the originator and the receiver are one external account.

* Execute a Contract
An interaction that interacts with a deployed smart contract, where the initiator is an external account and the receiver is a contract account.
