# What is Ethereum？
Ethereum is the infrastructure of WEB3.0：

* A blockchain network with built-in currency and payments.
* A blockchain network where users can own their data, and your applications cannot monitor and steal your data.
* An internet where everyone has access to an open financial system.
* An Internet built on a neutral, open infrastructure, not controlled by any company or individual.

Unlike the BTC blockchain network, Ethereum is programmable, which means developers can use it to build new types of applications.

Blockchain technology brings great benefits to these decentralized applications (dApps). dApps can be completely trustworthy because once they are deployed on Ethereum, they will always behave according to the logic predetermined by the program. DApps can also control digital assets to create new types of financial applications. They are completely decentralized, and no single entity or individual controls them.
