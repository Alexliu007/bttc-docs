# What is Gasï¼Ÿ
Gas refers to the amount of computational work required to perform a specific operation on the Ethereum network. Since each Ethereum transaction requires computational resources to execute, each transaction requires a fee. For example, to compute a Keccak256 cryptographic hash, it takes 30 Gas each time the hash is computed.
