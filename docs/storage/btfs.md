# BTFS

Compared with blockchains such as Ethereum, BTTC has the characteristics of low transaction fees, fast transaction speed, and high throughput, but limited by block size, transaction rate, etc., it still lacks cost-effective, scalable, and high-performance file storage and sharing solutions. One of the solutions to these problems is the BTFS file system.

### What is BTFS ï¼Ÿ

BitTorrent File System (BTFS), is the next-generation file sharing protocol in the BitTorrent-Chain ecosystem. It has the characteristics of decentralization, content addressing, peer to peer, and permanent storage. Further more, with the support of BTTC, BTFS realizes cross-chain connection and multi-channel payment, becoming a more convenient choice for decentralized storage.

The BTFS network is mainly composed of BTFS nodes, including host nodes and rental nodes. Rental nodes can upload files by paying WBTT, while host nodes provide storage in the network to get BTT rewards.
