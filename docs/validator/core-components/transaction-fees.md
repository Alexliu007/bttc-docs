# Transaction Fees

Each block producer on the Bttc layer is given a certain percentage of the transaction fees collected in each block.

The selection of producers for any given span is dependent on the validatorâ€™s ratio in the overall stake. The remaining transaction fees flow through the same funnel as the rewards which get shared among all validators working at the Delivery layer.
