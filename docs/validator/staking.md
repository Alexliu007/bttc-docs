# Staking
For BTTC Network, any participant can be qualified to become a BTTC's validator by running a full node to earn rewards and collect transaction fees. To ensure the good participation by validators, they lock up some of their BTTC tokens as a stake in the ecosystem.

Validators in BTTC Network are selected via an on-chain auction process which happens at regular intervals.

A validator has two addresses an owner address and a signer address. The staking is done with the owner address.

See also [Key Management](/docs/validator/core-components/key-management).

## Stake

:::note
Currently there is limited space to accept new validators.

A new validator can only join the active set when a currently active validator unbonds.
:::

To join the validator set, you must stake your BTT tokens. 

## Unstake

Unstaking allows the validator to be out of active pool of validators.

To ensure good participation, the validator stake is locked for 80 checkpoints.

## Restake

Validators can add more BTT tokens to their stake:

* To earn more rewards.
* To maintain the position in the validator set.
